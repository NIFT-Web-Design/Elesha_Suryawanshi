      <h2>About the craft: History of Bidri</h2>
      <div class="info">
        <img src="Images/img1.jpeg" alt="">

        <p>Bidriware is known to have its roots in ancient Persia but it developed and flourished in Bidar under the Bahmani Sultanate. During the Abbasid period in Persia (750-1258 A.D) copper inlaid objects were used in palaces and merchants’ homes. As the technique grew popular, silver and gold inlay also began and started being practiced in Islamic lands. There’s a high possibility that the art was brought by Iranian craftsmen who migrated to the Deccan regions. The Bahmani sultan allowed and invited lots of craftsmen to settle in their kingdoms. Bidri art traveled across many regions before it touched down in Bidar. Bidar is now in Karnataka state in southern India. Bahmani’s ruled the Deccan region in the 14th and 15th centuries. It is said that the Bahmani’s encourages art and took special interest to promote the same.</p>

          <p>Mr. Khaleel Ahmed is a Bidri artist from Hyderabad, Telangana. He has been practising this craft for the past 40 years. This craft has been passed on to him by his father who went to an arts and craft college. The workshop has a total of eight members and is entirely managed by his family. His sons know the art of bidri as well but they work more on the forefront of the business. They take care of the order placement, deliveries and social media handling. Mr. Ahmed was introduced to today's technology - Google Pay, Instagram, Facebook, etc by his sons. Personally for him this has helped him boost his business drastically. The ease of order placement, removal of middlemen and social media presence all have contributed to his business to a great extent.</p>
